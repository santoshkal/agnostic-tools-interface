For example, in a 3-zone cluster, MaxSkew is set to 1, and pods with the same labelSelector spread as 3/1/1: | zone1 | zone2 | zone3 | | P P P |   P   |   P   | If WhenUnsatisfiable is set to DoNotSchedule, incoming pod can only be scheduled to zone2(zone3) to become 3/2/1(3/1/2) as ActualSkew(2-1) on zone2(zone3) satisfies MaxSkew(1). In other words, the cluster can still be imbalanced, but scheduler won't make it *more* imbalanced. It's a required field.\n\nPossible enum values:\n - `\"DoNotSchedule\"` instructs the scheduler not to schedule the pod when constraints are not satisfied.\n - `\"ScheduleAnyway\"` instructs the scheduler to schedule the pod even if constraints are not satisfied."
